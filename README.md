# Veggie-cost-calculator
A simple application that helps vegetable vendors reduce losses and have fair sales

Often we see when Vegetable vendors sell vegetables, the weight is something like 530g but he charges only for 500g because that is a pretty simple calculation. With this sale he loses a very small amount of money, but as the day goes by and this keeps on repeating and by the end of the day, the vendor has lost a substantial sum of money.

This app aims to remove exactly this kind of loss and to make the process of the sale fair and simpler to understand for both the buyer and the seller.
